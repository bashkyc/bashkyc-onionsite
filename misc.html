Cake wallet features an integrated exchange with support for several currencies, including BTC, XMR, ETH, BCH, LTC, and more.
It is also possible to buy Bitcoin directly within Cake Wallet, though note that the payment provider will almost certainly require KYC.

Atomic Wallet is a multi-platform wallet which supports an very wide range of currencies.
It features an integrated exchange for cryptocurrencies,
as well as a way to buy cryptocurrency with fiat directly in the app (note that buying with fiat requires KYC).
Atomic Wallet is <strong>proprietary software, and is not fully open source</strong>.
For this reason, it should not be used for any sensitive transactions, or for holding large amounts of funds.
This wallet should only be used as a "catch-all" for sending and receiving small amounts of currencies which you don't care enough to install dedicated software for.
