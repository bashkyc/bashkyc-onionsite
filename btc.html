<br>
Samourai is a Bitcoin wallet for Android with sophisticated built-in privacy.
The primary feature is its integration of the
<a href="privacy.html#coinjoin">Whirlpool</a>
protocol, which aims to improve privacy and thwart chain-analysis.
Samourai also includes many other features such as "Ricochet" to improve fungibility, "Stonewall" for better transaction privacy, Tor to mask IPs, as well as Taproot, PayNyms, and more.

<br>
Sparrow is a desktop wallet with an emphasis on security, privacy, and usability.
Similarly to Samourai, Whirlpool & Stonewall can be used in order to obfuscate transaction history and improve privacy.
Meticulous organization and micromanagement of funds is made optionally available for advanced users,
while still providing an accessible interface for beginners.
Sparrow also features a private block explorer, Tor integration, support for PayNyms, and several methods of connection for interacting with the Bitcoin network.

Electrum is a multi-platform, well-established, and simplistic wallet for Bitcoin.
There's not much else to say, Electrum is old-fashioned, robust, and very popular.
If you want a wallet that is very simple and to-the-point, then Electrum is an excellent choice.

<h1 id="blue">Blue Wallet</h1>
<p class="aligncenter"><img src="images/btc/blue.png" alt="blue.png" width="747" height="597"></p>
<br>
Blue Wallet is a user-friendly wallet for Android, iOS, & macOS.
Several wallets can be set up and utilized at once, including regular, lightning, multisig, and view-only wallets.
Payjoin can optionally be used to improve transaction privacy.
Blue Wallet also allows the user to set up a "fake" wallet, which acts as a decoy and provides plausible deniability.
While the lightning network is supported, <strong>lightning wallets are custodial</strong>;
if it chooses to, the company is able to steal, monitor, or otherwise mishandle your lightning funds however it wants.
However, this removes the need to set up your own payment channels, and allows you to receive lightning payments while offline.

<h1 id="wasabi">Wasabi Wallet</h1>
<p class="aligncenter"><img src="images/btc/wasabi.png" alt="wasabi.png" width="883" height="527"></p>
<br>
Wasabi Wallet is a relatively popular and supposedly privacy-focused desktop wallet.
Wasabi is <strong>not recommended</strong>; use Sparrow Wallet instead.
Historically, Wasabi has used a very flimsy privacy technique, which has led to the deanonymization of countless unsuspecting users.
Wasabi has refused to acknowledge the deanonymization caused by their lousy and primitive implementation.
Additionally, their implementation of Coinjoin is only usable with large amounts, and the coordinator is now disallowing certain funds to be mixed.
