<h1 id="feather">Feather Wallet</h1>
<p class="aligncenter"><img src="images/xmr/feather.png" alt="feather.png" width="834" height="414"></p>
<br>
Feather is a user-friendly & lightweight desktop wallet for Monero, which looks and feels very similar to <a href="btc.html#electrum">Bitcoin's Electrum wallet</a>.
A 14-word seed is implemented instead of the standard 25-word seed, though 25-word seeds can still be imported and used in Feather.
Tor is used to better conceal the user's IP, and there are also built-in displays for CCS proposals and Reddit's r/Monero.

<br>
MyMonero is a lightweight and efficient multi-platform wallet, good for small amounts and day-to-day usage.
The user's device does not need to scan the blockchain for incoming transactions, as this is handled by the MyMonero servers.
This means that the user does not have to wait to sync with the network, however it results in a <strong>severe loss of privacy</strong>.
MyMonero can see all of your incoming transactions, and the amounts associated with them, when using their wallet.
They cannot, however, steal your funds.
