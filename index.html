<h2>About</h2>
<em>Last updated: July 6, 2022</em><br>
<br>
I created this site because I despise any and all infringment on the basic human rights to privacy and voluntary exchange.
This project was heavily inspired by
<a href="https://kycnot.me/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">kycnot.me</a>
and <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">privacytools.io</a>,
both of which are incredibly helpful resources.<br>

<strong>Q: What is KYC?</strong><br>
KYC stands for "Know Your Customer", or "Know Your Client".
Essentially it means that to use a service, you must provide personally-identifying information such as your name, phone number, driver's license, etc.
This information can be, and is, used to censor, surveil, and control what you do with <em>your</em> money and <em>your</em> life.
For this reason, KYC should be viewed with suspicion.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: What is AML?</strong><br>
AML stands for "Anti-Money Laundering".
AML is intended to prevent money laundering, generally by ensuring that the source of funds is known, and can be verified as legal.
It often goes hand-in-hand with KYC, and should be avoided for the same reasons.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Why should I trust you, or the accuracy of your recommendations?</strong><br>
You shouldn't trust me, or anyone else making software recommendations for that matter. Do your own research. I am providing mere suggestions for what may be helpful, it is ultimately up to <strong>you</strong> to figure out what works best in your case.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: What metrics do you use to assign your ratings?</strong><br>
I generally consider the following: UX, decentralization, quality of the product, accessibility, privacy, dev/code transparency, reputation, track record, and others.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Why does this site look so terrible and ugly?</strong><br>
I have quite limited expirience with webdesign.
It also doesn't help that Tor apparently doesn't like displaying pages how I intended.
In my defense, at least it fits in with 90% of the other websites in onionland.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Is the code for this site open-source?</strong><br>
Yes.
<a href="https://github.com/bashkyc/bashkyc-onionsite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Here is a link to the github page</a>.
Please don't bully me for my terrible HTML code.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Is there a clearnet (non-onion) version of this site?</strong><br>
There is
<a href="https://bashkyc.github.io/bashkyc-onionsite/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">a "mirror" on github</a>,
but I strongly suggest using the onion site for better privacy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Can I donate to this project?</strong><br>
Yes, and every penny is appreciated; It's not free to run a website. And despite the simplicity of this site, I spent an embarrasingly large amount of time on it, especially in terms of research.
Note that these addresses may change in the future.<br>
